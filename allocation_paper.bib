  abstract = {This paper describes the development of a novel metaheuristic that combines an electromagnetic-like mechanism (EM) and the great deluge algorithm (GD) for the University course timetabling problem. This well-known timetabling problem assigns lectures to specific numbers of timeslots and rooms maximizing the overall quality of the timetable while taking various constraints into account. EM is a population-based stochastic global optimization algorithm that is based on the theory of physics, simulating attraction and repulsion of sample points in moving toward optimality. GD is a local search procedure that allows worse solutions to be accepted based on some given upper boundary or ‘level’. In this paper, the dynamic force calculated from the attraction-repulsion mechanism is used as a decreasing rate to update the ‘level’ within the search process. The proposed method has been applied to a range of benchmark university course timetabling test problems from the literature. Moreover, the viability of the method has been tested by comparing its results with other reported results from the literature, demonstrating that the method is able to produce improved solutions to those currently published. We believe this is due to the combination of both approaches and the ability of the resultant algorithm to converge all solutions at every search process.},

  abstract = {The course timetabling problem deals with the assignment of a set of courses to specific timeslots and rooms within a working week subject to a variety of hard and soft constraints. Solutions which satisfy the hard constraints are called feasible. The goal is to satisfy as many of the soft constraints as possible whilst constructing a feasible schedule. In this paper, we present a composite neighbourhood structure with a randomised iterative improvement algorithm. This algorithm always accepts an improved solution and a worse solution is accepted with a certain probability. The algorithm is tested over eleven benchmark datasets (representing one large, five medium and five small problems). The results demonstrate that our approach is able to produce solutions that have lower penalty on all the small problems and two of the medium problems when compared against other techniques from the literature. However, in the case of the medium problems, this is at the expense of significantly increased computational time.},

Yet group dynamics can markedly influence an individual’s response, and thus the overall solution quality. Via theoretical worst-case analysis, we analyze certain common behaviors of Doodle poll respondents, including when participants are either more generous with or more protective of their time, showing that deviating from one’s “true availability” can have a substantial impact on the overall quality of the selected time. We show perhaps counter-intuitively that being more generous with your time can lead to inferior time slots being selected, and being more protective of your time can lead to superior time slots being selected. We also bound the improvement and degradation of outcome quality under both types of behaviors.},

Policies designed to encourage more women to enter a competitive environment served to recruit enough high-performing individuals to ensure that the efficiency in performing the task was preserved.                                Beaman                 et al.                              (p.               582               , published online 12 January) examined the effects of a constitutionally mandated reservation of village-council and council-leader positions for women in West Bengal after two election cycles (1998 and 2003). The program appeared to narrow the gender gap in aspirations of parents for their children and of children for themselves; in addition, teenage girls spent more time in school and less on household chores. Beliefs and attitudes changed only after the second set of elections—that is, after a longer exposure to female role models—complementing the more rapid policy changes instituted by women council leaders after the first round of elections.                        ,              Increasing the representation of competition-averse individuals does not alter overall output.           ,              Gender differences in choosing to enter competitions are one source of unequal labor market outcomes concerning wages and promotions. Given that studying the effects of policy interventions to support women is difficult with field data because of measurement problems and potential lack of control, we evaluated, in a set of controlled laboratory experiments, four interventions: quotas, where one of two winners of a competition must be female; two variants of preferential treatment, where a fixed increment is added to women’s performance; and repetition of the competition, where a second competition takes place if no woman is among the winners. Compared with no intervention, all interventions encourage women to enter competitions more often, and performance is at least equally good, both during and after the competition.},

  abstract = {Abstract             How does the human brain support real-world learning? We used wireless electroencephalography to collect neurophysiological data from a group of 12 senior high school students and their teacher during regular biology lessons. Six scheduled classes over the course of the semester were organized such that class materials were presented using different teaching styles (videos and lectures), and students completed a multiple-choice quiz after each class to measure their retention of that lesson's content. Both students' brain-to-brain synchrony and their content retention were higher for videos than lectures across the six classes. Brain-to-brain synchrony between the teacher and students varied as a function of student engagement as well as teacher likeability: Students who reported greater social closeness to the teacher showed higher brain-to-brain synchrony with the teacher, but this was only the case for lectures—that is, when the teacher is an integral part of the content presentation. Furthermore, students' retention of the class content correlated with student–teacher closeness, but not with brain-to-brain synchrony. These findings expand on existing social neuroscience research by showing that social factors such as perceived closeness are reflected in brain-to-brain synchrony in real-world group settings and can predict cognitive outcomes such as students' academic performance.},

  abstract = {In conceptual properties norming studies (CPNs), participants list properties that describe a set of concepts. From CPNs, many different parameters are calculated, such as semantic richness. A generally overlooked issue is that those values are only point estimates of the true unknown population parameters. In the present work, we present an R package that allows us to treat those values as population parameter estimates. Relatedly, a general practice in CPNs is using an equal number of participants who list properties for each concept (i.e., standardizing sample size). As we illustrate through examples, this procedure has negative effects on data’s statistical analyses. Here, we argue that a better method is to standardize coverage (i.e., the proportion of sampled properties to the total number of properties that describe a concept), such that a similar coverage is achieved across concepts. When standardizing coverage rather than sample size, it is more likely that the set of concepts in a CPN all exhibit a similar representativeness. Moreover, by computing coverage the researcher can decide whether the CPN reached a sufficiently high coverage, so that its results might be generalizable to other studies. The R package we make available in the current work allows one to compute coverage and to estimate the necessary number of participants to reach a target coverage. We show this sampling procedure by using the R package on real and simulated CPN data.},

Recently, a set of benchmark instances was introduced and used for an ‘International Timetabling Competition’ to which 24 algorithms were submitted by various research groups active in the field of timetabling. We describe and analyse a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm which was developed under the very same rules and deadlines imposed by the competition and outperformed the official winner. It combines various construction heuristics, tabu search, variable neighbourhood descent and simulated annealing. Due to the complexity of developing hybrid metaheuristics, we strongly relied on an experimental methodology for configuring the algorithms as well as for choosing proper parameter settings. In particular, we used racing procedures that allow an automatic or semi-automatic configuration of algorithms with a good save in time. Our successful example shows that the systematic design of hybrid algorithms through an experimental methodology leads to high performing algorithms for hard combinatorial optimisation problems.},

In particular, cross-lagged regression coefficients may vary, depending on the respective time lags between different sets of measurement occasions. This article introduces the concept of an optimal time lag. Further, it is demonstrated that optimal time lags in panel studies are related to the stabilities of the variables investigated, and that in unidirectional systems, they may be unrelated to the size of possible true effects. The results presented also suggest that optimal time lags for panel designs are usually quite short. Implications are (a) that interpreting cross-lagged regression coefficients requires taking the time lag between measurement occasions into account, and (b) that in much research, far shorter time lags than those frequently found in the literature are justifiable, and we call for more “shortitudinal” studies in the future.

The current article examines a sample of 91 recent meta-analyses published in American Psychological Association and Association for Psychological Science journals and the methods used in these analyses to identify and control for publication bias. Of the 91 studies analyzed, 64 (70\%) made some effort to analyze publication bias, and 26 (41\%) reported finding evidence of bias. Approaches to controlling publication bias were heterogeneous among studies. Of these studies, 57 (63\%) attempted to find unpublished studies to control for publication bias. Nonetheless, those studies that included unpublished studies were just as likely to find evidence for publication bias as those that did not. Furthermore, authors of meta-analyses themselves were overrepresented in unpublished studies acquired, as compared with published studies, suggesting that searches for unpublished studies may increase rather than decrease some sources of bias. A subset of 48 meta-analyses for which study sample sizes and effect sizes were available was further analyzed with a conservative and newly developed tandem procedure of assessing publication bias. Results indicated that publication bias was worrisome in about 25\% of meta-analyses. Meta-analyses that included unpublished studies were more likely to show bias than those that did not, likely due to selection bias in unpublished literature searches. Sources of publication bias and implications for the use of meta-analysis are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

(p.               613               ; see the Perspective by                                Putterman                              ) show that communication among the group members is key, both to establishing a maintainable rate of harvesting, as well as enforcement via punishment of noncompliers.                                Boyd                 et al.                              (p.               617               ; see the Perspective by                                Putterman                              ) develop a model showing that punishment, which is a costly activity, is most effectively levied when implemented with the approval of group members; that is, coordinated punishment works to the benefit of the whole, whereas individual actions do not.                        ,              Communication and coordination are essential components in cooperative endeavors.           ,              Governance of social-ecological systems is a major policy problem of the contemporary era. Field studies of fisheries, forests, and pastoral and water resources have identified many variables that influence the outcomes of governance efforts. We introduce an experimental environment that involves spatial and temporal resource dynamics in order to capture these two critical variables identified in field research. Previous behavioral experiments of commons dilemmas have found that people are willing to engage in costly punishment, frequently generating increases in gross benefits, contrary to game-theoretical predictions based on a static pay-off function. Results in our experimental environment find that costly punishment is again used but lacks a gross positive effect on resource harvesting unless combined with communication. These findings illustrate the importance of careful generalization from the laboratory to the world of policy.},

  abstract = {The current study represented a replication of previous research, addressing measures of interpersonal relatedness as predictors of outcome for dynamically oriented, short-term group (STG) psychotherapy for patients presenting with complicated grief. In an analysis of data from a comparative trial of two forms (interpretive, supportive) of STG therapy (n = 107), Ogrodniczuk, Piper, McCallum, Joyce and Rosie reported that three distinct indices of interpersonal relatedness—quality of object relations, current social functioning and attachment insecurity—each had significant relationships with measures of treatment outcome, with attachment insecurity emerging as the strongest predictor. The current study (n = 110) was based on data from a subsequent trial of the two therapy approaches that examined the effect of group composition on outcome, by Piper, Ogrodniczuk, Joyce, Weideman and Rosie. Predictor variables and outcome factors involved in the current analyses were similar or identical to those employed by Ogrodniczuk et al., and an identical analytic strategy was followed. Only the patient's attachment insecurity emerged as a strong predictor of psychotherapy outcome, providing a replication of the key finding from the previous study. The clinical implications and limitations of the results are discussed. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: • Complicated grief (CG) is a distinct syndrome that is associated with definite distress and problems in functioning; there are empirically supported treatments available for CG. • Characteristics of the patient can influence the success of these treatments. • In particular, the patient's capacity for interpersonal relatedness will help determine the quality of engagement in the therapy process and treatment outcome. • Attachment insecurity is an important aspect of interpersonal relatedness and, based on replicated findings reported here, has a clear relationship with benefit from short-term group therapy for CG.},

They have been shown to affect our thoughts, emotions, behavior, and social relations in a variety of social contexts, and have more recently been linked to our mental and physical well-being. Questions remain, however, over the dynamics between different group memberships and the ways in which we cognitively and emotionally acquire these. In particular, current assessment methods are missing that can be applied to naturally occurring data, such as online interactions, to better understand the dynamics and impact of group memberships in naturalistic settings. To provide researchers with a method for assessing specific group memberships of interest, we have developed ASIA (Automated Social Identity Assessment), an analytical protocol that uses linguistic style indicators in text to infer which group membership is salient in a given moment, accompanied by an in-depth open-source Jupyter Notebook tutorial (https://github.com/Identity-lab/Tutorial-on-salient-social-Identity-detection-model). Here, we first discuss the challenges in the study of salient group memberships, and how ASIA can address some of these. We then demonstrate how our analytical protocol can be used to create a method for assessing which of two specific group memberships—parents and feminists—is salient using online forum data, and how the quality (validity) of the measurement and its interpretation can be tested using two further corpora as well as an experimental study. We conclude by discussing future developments in the field.},

We refer to group-level cognitive activity as social cognition, a term that we apply collectively to those social processes involved in the acquisition, storage, transmission, manipulation and use of information for the purpose of creating a group-level intellective product. In this context, the word ‘social’ is used to denote how cognition is accomplished, not its content. It is proposed that at least some social cognition occurs in every kind of group problem-solving situation, though the amount and type depends on the specific problem-solving functions that need to be addressed in order to reach a problem solution. We examine a number of these functions, and consider how they are served by various group member actions. This analysis is informed (though not determined) by certain functional analogies that can be found between individual-level and group-level (i.e. social) cognition. The benefits of adopting a functional orientation to understanding group problem solving are discussed.},

However, little guidance exists in the published literature regarding techniques for detecting careless responses. Previously several potential approaches have been suggested for identifying careless respondents via indices computed from the data, yet almost no prior work has examined the relationships among these indicators or the types of data patterns identified by each. In 2 studies, we examined several methods for identifying careless responses, including (a) special items designed to detect careless response, (b) response consistency indices formed from responses to typical survey items, (c) multivariate outlier analysis, (d) response time, and (e) self-reported diligence. Results indicated that there are two distinct patterns of careless response (random and nonrandom) and that different indices are needed to identify these different response patterns. We also found that approximately 10\%–12\% of undergraduates completing a lengthy survey for course credit were identified as careless responders. In Study 2, we simulated data with known random response patterns to determine the efficacy of several indicators of careless response. We found that the nature of the data strongly influenced the efficacy of the indices to identify careless responses. Recommendations include using identified rather than anonymous responses, incorporating instructed response items before data collection, as well as computing consistency indices and multivariate outlier analysis to ensure high-quality data.

As such, the research aimed to articulate their views as a contribution to the debate about the future form and function of the school science curriculum. The method adopted to elicit their views was to use focus groups-a methodology that has not been extensively used in the science education research. Reported here are the findings from 20 focus groups conducted with 144 16-year-old pupils in London, Leeds and Birmingham, split both by gender and whether the pupils intended to continue, or not, with the study of science post-16. The findings of this research offer a window into pupils' perspective of school science revealing both their discontents and satisfaction with the existing curriculum. On the negative side, many pupils perceived school science to be a subject dominated by content with too much repetition and too little challenge. From a more positive perspective, pupils saw the study of science as important and were engaged by topics where they could perceive an immediate relevance, practical work, material that was challenging and high-quality teaching. The implications of these findings and the insights they provide for curriculum policy and school science curricula are discussed.},

Setting Six U.S. cities. Participants A volunteer sample of 2,832 persons (mean baseline age 73.6; 26\% African American) living independently. Intervention Ten training sessions for memory, reasoning, or speed of processing; four sessions of booster training 11 and 35 months after initial training. Measurements Objectively measured cognitive abilities and self-reported and performance-based measures of everyday function. Results Participants in each intervention group reported less difficulty with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) (memory: effect size = 0.48, 99\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.12–0.84; reasoning: effect size = 0.38, 99\% CI = 0.02–0.74; speed of processing: effect size = 0.36, 99\% CI = 0.01–0.72). At a mean age of 82, approximately 60\% of trained participants, versus 50\% of controls (P {$<$} .05), were at or above their baseline level of self-reported IADL function at 10 years. The reasoning and speed-of-processing interventions maintained their effects on their targeted cognitive abilities at 10 years (reasoning: effect size = 0.23, 99\% CI = 0.09–0.38; speed of processing: effect size = 0.66, 99\% CI = 0.43–0.88). Memory training effects were no longer maintained for memory performance. Booster training produced additional and durable improvement for the reasoning intervention for reasoning performance (effect size = 0.21, 99\% CI = 0.01–0.41) and the speed-of-processing intervention for speed-of-processing performance (effect size = 0.62, 99\% CI = 0.31–0.93). Conclusion Each Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly cognitive intervention resulted in less decline in self-reported IADL compared with the control group. Reasoning and speed, but not memory, training resulted in improved targeted cognitive abilities for 10 years.},

  abstract = {Researchers have ample reasons to take their experimental studies out of the lab and into the online wilderness. For some, it is out of necessity, due to an unforeseen laboratory closure or difficulties in recruiting on-site participants. Others want to benefit from the large and diverse online population. However, the transition from in-lab to online data acquisition is not trivial and might seem overwhelming at first. To facilitate this transition, we present an overview of actively maintained solutions for the critical components of successful online data acquisition: creating, hosting and recruiting. Our aim is to provide a brief introductory resource and discuss important considerations for researchers who are taking their first steps towards online experimentation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an iterated local search algorithm is proposed to find the feasible solution for the University Course Timetabling Problem. Three key phases are involved in the proposed algorithm framework: initialization, intensification and diversification. Once a partial-feasible initial timetable is constructed, a simulated annealing based local search and a diversification procedure that brings moderate perturbation or even improvement to the current solution are performed in an iterative manner until a stop condition is met. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a widely used dataset containing 60 problem instances. The computational results show the iterated local search algorithm achieves highly competitive results compared with the existing algorithms. It is noteworthy that this algorithm can find feasible solutions for 58 instances in reasonable time, including three large instances whose feasible solutions are missed in previous papers. Furthermore, some key elements and properties of the algorithm are also analyzed.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the collective creative problem solving (CPS) processes and beliefs within a self-regulated learning (SRL) framework within a younger population, in order to further the research and provide practical advice to practitioners. Third through twelfth grade students (N = 120) competed in a creative problem-solving competition in which appraisers evaluated their creative problem-solving (e.g. teamwork, creativity, effective solution). Using a Micro-Macro Mutli-Level Modeling (MMMLM) analysis approach, this study sought to account for the multi-level nature of the data in the team-based environment in which the predictor variables were at the individual level and the outcome was at the team-level. Many of the individual forethought variables correlated (i.e. participant age, mastery experiences, creative collective efficacy, task value, and outcome expectations) with the team outcomes, and the model, including all forethought variables, explains approximately 64 \% of the variance in the team score. The results also show that task value was the only forethought variable to significantly predict the team score outcome variable after accounting for the nested structure of the data.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in model selection and the appraisal of psychological theory. The focus is on latent variable models, given their growing use in theory testing and construction. Theoretical statistical results in regression are discussed, and more important issues are illustrated with novel simulations involving latent variable models including factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and factor mixture models. Asymptotically, the BIC is consistent, in that it will select the true model if, among other assumptions, the true model is among the candidate models considered. The AIC is not consistent under these circumstances. When the true model is not in the candidate model set the AIC is efficient, in that it will asymptotically choose whichever model minimizes the mean squared error of prediction/estimation. The BIC is not efficient under these circumstances. Unlike the BIC, the AIC also has a minimax property, in that it can minimize the maximum possible risk in finite sample sizes. In sum, the AIC and BIC have quite different properties that require different assumptions, and applied researchers and methodologists alike will benefit from improved understanding of the asymptotic and finite-sample behavior of these criteria. The ultimate decision to use the AIC or BIC depends on many factors, including the loss function employed, the study's methodological design, the substantive research question, and the notion of a true model and its applicability to the study at hand.

  abstract = {A police lineup is a procedure in which a suspect is surrounded by known-innocent persons (fillers) and presented to the witness for an identification attempt. The purpose of a lineup is to test the investigator’s hypothesis that the suspect is the culprit, and the investigator uses the witness’ identification decision and the associated confidence level to inform this hypothesis. Whereas suspect identifications provide evidence of guilt, filler identifications and rejections provide evidence of innocence. Despite the capacity of lineups to provide exculpatory information, past research has focused, almost exclusively, on inculpatory behaviors. We recently developed a method for incorporating all lineup outcomes in a single receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The area under the full lineup ROC curve reflects the total capacity of a lineup procedure to discriminate guilty suspects from innocent suspects. Here, we introduce a Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) package, fullROC, to support eyewitness researchers in using the full ROC approach to analyze lineup data. The fullROC package provides functions for adjusting identification rates, generating full ROC curves for lineup data, computing the area under the ROC curves (AUC), and statistically comparing the AUCs of different lineups. Using both simulated and empirical data, we illustrate the functionality of the fullROC CRAN package. In brief, the fullROC package provides a useful tool for eyewitness researchers to analyze lineup data using the full ROC method, which incorporates both the inculpatory and exculpatory information of eyewitness behaviors.},

  abstract = {A global priority for the behavioural sciences is to develop cost-effective, scalable interventions that could improve the academic outcomes of adolescents at a population level, but no such interventions have so far been evaluated in a population-generalizable sample. Here we show that a short (less than one hour), online growth mindset intervention—which teaches that intellectual abilities can be developed—improved grades among lower-achieving students and increased overall enrolment to advanced mathematics courses in a nationally representative sample of students in secondary education in the United States. Notably, the study identified school contexts that sustained the effects of the growth mindset intervention: the intervention changed grades when peer norms aligned with the messages of the intervention. Confidence in the conclusions of this study comes from independent data collection and processing, pre-registration of analyses, and corroboration of results by a blinded Bayesian analysis.},

  abstract = {Recent randomized experiments have found that seemingly ?small? social-psychological interventions in education?that is, brief exercises that target students? thoughts, feelings, and beliefs in and about school?can lead to large gains in student achievement and sharply reduce achievement gaps even months and years later. These interventions do not teach students academic content but instead target students? psychology, such as their beliefs that they have the potential to improve their intelligence or that they belong and are valued in school. When social-psychological interventions have lasting effects, it can seem surprising and even ?magical,? leading people either to think of them as quick fixes to complicated problems or to consider them unworthy of serious consideration. The present article discourages both responses. It reviews the theoretical basis of several prominent social-psychological interventions and emphasizes that they have lasting effects because they target students? subjective experiences in school, because they use persuasive yet stealthy methods for conveying psychological ideas, and because they tap into recursive processes present in educational environments. By understanding psychological interventions as powerful but context-dependent tools, educational researchers will be better equipped to take them to scale. This review concludes by discussing challenges to scaling psychological interventions and how these challenges may be overcome.},
